# Train-Scheduler

###### Alllllll Aboard!! 
This is a train scheduling application that uses **Firebase** to host relevant data. Train-Scheduler uses **Moment.js** to retrieve and manipulate time-related data, thus providing the user with up-to-date information for all trains. Users can add trains using the Add Train form at the bottom of the page. This will update Firebase, allowing any and all users to view the added trains. 

Languages and Libraries used include: **HTML**, **CSS**, **Javascript**, **jQuery**, **Bootstrap**, **Moment.js**, **Firebase**, and **Google Fonts**
